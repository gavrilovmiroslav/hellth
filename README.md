# HELLTH

"You are the latest in a long line of acolytes sent to venture into the Ruins of the World in the hopes of slaying the Healer. Let not yourself be fooled by that name -- this person brought ruin; he remade the world by collapsing the Spiritual Divide. Going down doesn't require only time, but sacrifice...
Staircases going down don't exist. Consume. Grow. Sacrifice. Find a way.
This challenge will see you use and consume artifacts that inflict upon your health strange glyphs to affect your state. It shall change how you perceive things. It shall make you wonder about your choices. Remember the shape of your soul and track it carefully. Remember that in this place NINE is the strength with which devotion accepts a sacrifice. Be wary of what you ask for. Remember it in your BONES"

HELLTH /no pain, no gain/ is a roguelike in which thaumaturgically consuming your enemies changes your build. To go down a level, you need to either get at least one stat to 9, or instead permanently lose some amount of health. Use this knowledge to cast doom on others, or cut them down while infused with the enemies you previously killed. Make your way to level five and take your swing at the Healer.
